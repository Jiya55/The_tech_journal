    Microsoft's C# programming language is used to create back-end services, desktop programmes, video games, augmented and virtual reality (AR and VR), and interactive websites and mobile apps. C# runs on the.NET framework, which is a collection of tools and commands that allows you to create C# applications. Unlike Python and JavaScript, C# requires you to specify the data type for each variable in a programme. Providing a piece of data a type effectively instructs a computer what operations it can and cannot carry out on it. This method of coding helps developers in avoiding a vast class of mistakes that are prevalent in JavaScript and Python. C# programmes are created by defining objects that interact with one another, making code reusable and simple to manage. The C# code has the.cs file extension. The following code must be created in order to create a programme that prints Hello World.

I am using Visual Studio in Windows. You can download Visual Studio from <a href='https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/'> this website </a> . We need to choose Visual Studio and not visual studio code. While downloading we need to choose the option .NET desktop development. After downloading click on new and project on the upper taskbar. Choose the console app. Give it a name. you can then write your C# code. To run it you need to click on start.
